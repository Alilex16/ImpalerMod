# ImpalerMod
This is my first time writing in Java and my first attempt at a mod for <b>Slay the Spire</b>. I hope you enjoy it and please let me know if there's any bugs (besides the Vampire event).

The Impaler is all about the balance between HP gain and cost. Please note due to the nature of this mod, it's pretty hard to balance, if you feel a card is useless or very OP, please leave a message and elaborate.

Total of 82 new cards:
* 26 attacks
* 31 skills
* 19 powers
* 6 curses

2 potions

11 relics



All constructive feedback is welcome.

Thank you for reading. :-)
